maybe just like , u can see this , the qqq and gld rate will not vary very extrwme a lot over long time (becasue this is not actual price, so it will relatively be better for gird strategy , which works best in a stable area). so, i think it is good for doing a grid stretegy over the 2 assset dustri utin (when asset1 / asset2 been high , then sell asset 1 to buy asset 2 ) . or she like this , i think it will be a good idea . can u wiret a grid stretegy calss for me ? i want to do a Boolean tunnel combined grid strategy. 

for the new class , i think we need new data structure.
1. asset profolio (asset data 1 , asset data 2 , percent 1, percent 2 , total init capital)
this presents the initial distribution of the assets 
2. transection ( buy/sell ,asset, share )


the 2asset Boolean grid class strategy calss should be like  init  (unit (total profolio percent),grid dense(int), profolio , minimun asset1 percebt . munimune asset 2 percent , Boolean width , ) , and we can got a function: run to return a listst of transections for these 2 aseet from start date to end date.

and i want this class include a plotting function (start date , end date) . so if a Boolean grid object is created, we can both call the run and plot to show the strategy result. 

 as for the core function it self, it will be easy, the grid will be the width of boolean tunnel / grid dense(int) , the anchor point will be the average ratio of the 2 assets in the provide time priod. (the bolean mid line ).when the condition triggerd , just record a transection(if asset1/aseset2 up,sell asset1 to  buy asset 2 and vise versa) in the transection list(beeing a globalvariable inside the calss).

and there will be some edge case , for example ,the proce go up or down  over the boolean tunnel , or the holding shre of a asset is below the limited percent, or one asset is simply has zero share , we should just skip any trnasection and wait.

if u can got all these ideas , give me the new block about this stretegy 

//
the thing u draw out is like this , and this is not waht i want, here is the list that i want u to revise for : 
1. firstly, your boolean is not moving with the price, the boolean shoyld be calculated dynamically fillowing the price
2. the width should not be a strict number , hould be the meaning of how much statndard deviation
3. u only include the sell qqq but gld , but we alos need the inverse side (sell gld buy qqq).
4. the trading logic of u made seems stramge . the ideal trading record should be , we will trade when the price is in the boolean tuneel , and if the prcie or our profolio distribution meet the edge case , or out of boolean tunnel , just wait and od not operation. but u onlu trade oustlde of teh boolean tunnel , whci his not my meanning.

// 
some thing to tell , first , the class should be called booleanGridStrategy, and the asset name we bnuild previos blocks are (asset1=asset_qqq, asset2=asset_gld). 
 and the signak u defined lack of a "share" facotr , means how muahc share do u trade. and the one trading unit should also be a float parameteor "transection unit " like 0.05 or sth, means that each reallocatie (for eacmle form asset 2 to asset 1 ) should be at the unit of the current full capital value * transection unit 

there are still some of misunderstand of your version of the algorthm itself:

1. the "window" u wrote should be the MA aveage time right ? but we need anothjer  "grid_dense" factor, whcih means "deviding the current diference from the boolean upper to buttom  ", this factor is used to determine current grid unit scale (so probbly boit being like 20 , maybe will be sth like 5, beacuse it aslo varies form the width variation of boolean tunnelk)
2. after geting the grid scale, the logic we want to do is , when the ratio goes down for one grid , but more asset2 and sell aasset 1 (a buy asset2 signal) and vise versa. and if the edge condition happens (go out of the booleab tunnel) . just wiat and give no signal.
for example , if the  currnt ratio's up is 2, down is 1, and grid_dense is 5 , means that the grid unit is 0.2 , whne the cirrent line go down for each 0.2, we will trigger  transection units of asset moving from asset 1 to aset 2 to buy low , and if it is going high , we also sell the asme value from asset 2 to buy aset 1 back , that is the meaning of grid
